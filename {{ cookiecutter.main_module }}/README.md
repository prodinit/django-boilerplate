## Getting up and running

Minimum requirements: **pip, python3.9, poetry, redis & [PostgreSQL 11][install-postgres]**, setup is tested on Mac OSX only.

```
brew install python3 poetry libmagic postgres
```

[install-postgres]: http://www.gotealeaf.com/blog/how-to-install-postgresql-on-a-mac

### Poetry

To guarantee repeatable installations, all project dependencies are managed using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). The projectâ€™s direct dependencies are listed in `pyproject.toml`.
Running `poetry lock` generates `poetry.lock` which has all versions pinned.

You can install Poetry by using `pip install --pre poetry` or by following the official installation guide [here](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry#installation).

*Tip:* We recommend that you use this workflow and keep `pyproject.toml` as well as `poetry.lock` under version control to make sure all computers and environments run exactly the same code.

### Celery
To run Celery
`celery -A {{ cookiecutter.main_module }} worker -l info`

To run Celery Beat:
`celery -A {{ cookiecutter.main_module }} beat -l info --scheduler django_celery_beat.schedulers:DatabaseScheduler`

### Other tools

For compatibility, `requirements.txt` and `requirements_dev.txt` can be updated by running

```bash
poetry export --without-hashes -f requirements.txt -o requirements.txt
```

and

```bash
poetry export --without-hashes -f requirements.txt -o requirements_dev.txt --with dev
```

, respectively.
